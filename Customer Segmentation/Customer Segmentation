This is a KMeans customer segmentation analysis conducted in Python.

The objective is to identify distinct groups of customers to better target the market. 
After conducting preliminary data analysis, I applied the KMeans clustering algorithm to partition the customers into clusters.

Interestingly, through comparisons with various preprocessing techniques, it appears that the model performs better when applied without any preprocessing steps. 
This finding suggests that the inherent structure of the data is effectively captured by the raw features without the need for scaling or other preprocessing techniques.
